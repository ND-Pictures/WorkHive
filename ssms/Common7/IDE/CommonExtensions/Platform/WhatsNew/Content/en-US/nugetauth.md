title: Enhanced NuGet Authentication

We've improved the NuGet authentication process. If we detect any potential authentication issues, you'll now see a new authentication dialog that provides context about the feed and the specific account needs.

This update enhances the reauthentication process for multi-factor authentication (MFA) scenarios, resolves issues with consecutive authentication prompts, and ensures a smoother overall experience when managing private NuGet feeds.
