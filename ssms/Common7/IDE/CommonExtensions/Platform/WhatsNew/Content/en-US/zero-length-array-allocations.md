The .NET Allocation Tool now provides detailed insights into zero-length array allocations, helping you identify and optimize unnecessary memory usage. While these allocations may seem insignificant individually, they can accumulate quickly and impact performance, especially in high-performance or memory-constrained applications.

With this update, you can investigate zero-length array allocations by clicking the Investigate link, which opens the Allocation View displaying allocation details. Double-clicking reveals code paths where these allocations occur, enabling precise optimizations. To improve efficiency, consider using `Array.Empty<T>()`, a statically allocated empty array instance, to eliminate redundant memory allocations.
